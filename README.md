HAI_Validator_4_MU3
=======

For 2018, Antimicrobial Resistance and Antimicrobial Use reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) 
has been identified as a new option for public health registry reporting under Meaningful Use Stage 3.  
See https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/03/30/2015-06612/2015-edition-health-information-technology-health-it-certification-criteria-2015-edition-base.  
See certification criterion ( 170.315(f)(6)).    

In order to qualify as certified technology an EHR or EHR Module must be capable of 
creating  Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents for 
Antimicrobial Use and Resistance conformant to the HL7 Implementation Guide for 
CDA ? Release 2—Level 3: Healthcare Associated Infection Reports, Release 1—US Realm—August 2013.  
See http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=20.   
The following CDAs must all be successfully generated.
•	Antimicrobial Resistance Option (ARO) Report (Numerator) specific document template in Section 2.1.2.1 (pages 69-72);
•	Antimicrobial Resistance Option (ARO) Summary Report (Denominator) specific document template in Section 2.1.1.1 (pages 54-56);
•	Antimicrobial Use (AUP) Summary Report (Numerator and Denominator) specific document template in Section 2.1.1.2 (pages 56-58)
The validator checks the aforementioned CDAs for three levels of conformance. 

•	Check for valid XML
•	Check that the file validates against the cda.xsl schema
•	Check that the file validates against the hai.sch Schematron

The schema and schematron files were all developed by Lantana Consulting Group 
(see http://www.lantanagroup.com/ )under contract to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC).

This validator uses an open source tool called Probatron (see https://code.google.com/archive/p/probatron4j/)
as well as custom scripting.  Probatron.jar is included in the installation zip file.
